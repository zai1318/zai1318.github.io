I am Zohaib Khan, a Ph.D. candidate in Control Science and Engineering at Jiangsu University in my last semester.
My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and robotic perception, with a focus on object detection, semantic and instance segmentation, and data-efficient model learning.
I am broadly interested in developing robust, real-time vision and control systems for intelligent machines operating in dynamic environments spanning applications from agricultural robotics to industrial inspection, autonomous navigation, and human–robot collaboration.

### 🧠 Research Interests
- Deep Learning for Vision: CNNs & Transformers for object detection and semantic/instance segmentation
- Learning Paradigms: Supervised and unsupervised learning (including self-/semi-supervised)
- Robustness & Generalization: Domain adaptation, augmentation, and cross-environment evaluation
- Data Efficiency: Active learning, dataset design, and annotation strategies
- Real-Time Deployment: Model compression/quantization and edge implementation on embedded/robotic platforms
- Applications: Perception systems for robotics, automations, and field environments under occlusion, lighting variation, and sensor noise
