I am Zohaib Khan, a Ph.D. candidate in Control Science and Engineering at Jiangsu University in my last semester.
My research focuses on machine learning and computer vision for agricultural robotics, with particular emphasis on object detection, semantic segmentation, and data-efficient model learning.
I aim to develop robust, real-time perception systems capable of reliable operation in complex outdoor environments.
