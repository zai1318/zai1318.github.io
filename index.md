I am Zohaib Khan, a Ph.D. candidate in Control Science and Engineering at Jiangsu University in my last semester.
My research focuses on machine learning and computer vision for agricultural robotics, with particular emphasis on object detection, semantic segmentation, and data-efficient model learning.
I aim to develop robust, real-time perception systems capable of reliable operation in complex outdoor environments.

### 🧠 Research Interests
- Deep Learning for Vision: CNNs & Transformers for object detection and semantic/instance segmentation
- Learning Paradigms: Supervised and unsupervised learning (including self-/semi-supervised)
- Robustness & Generalization: Domain adaptation, augmentation, and shift-aware evaluation
- Data Efficiency: Active learning, dataset design, and annotation strategies
- Real-Time Deployment: Model compression/quantization/pruning for edge devices
- Applied CV in Agriculture: Field perception under occlusion, illumination change, and sensor noise
