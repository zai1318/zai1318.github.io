Hi, I'm Zohaib Khan, a Ph.D. candidate in Control Science and Engineering at Jiangsu University.  
My work centers on machine learning and deep learning for computer vision, with an application focus on agricultural robotics. I develop and deploy models for object detection and segmentation, emphasizing data-efficient learning and robust, real-time inference in challenging outdoor environments.
